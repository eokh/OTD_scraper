# On This Day Scraper – Unga Bunga Edition 🔥🪨🦴

## Why This Exists
Fire let early humans share warmth and light. Knowledge does the same for the present.  
This project treats a first Python script as that first spark – a handmade answer to the industrial glow of modern AI. By scraping Wikipedia’s **On This Day** list and carving it into a digital cave wall, it links the dawn of storytelling to today’s code. As the script matures it will grow from crude glyphs to cathedral-scale narrative, the way cave art once bloomed into the Sistine Chapel and now into personalized feeds.

## What Unga Bunga Do
A short, sharp script stalks the Wikipedia cave, grabs the daily historical embers, cleans away citation clutter, and presents the stories for humans to pass around the communal fire.

### Tribe-Approved Features
* **Story Hunter** – fetches “On This Day” events  
* **Glyph Smasher** – strips `[1]`, `[2]`, and similar debris  
* **Rock Carver** – writes to `on_this_day_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`  
* **Story Teller** – prints to terminal  
* **Spirit Resistant** – retries on network errors  
* **Disguise Master** – polite User-Agent so Wikipedia stays calm  
* **Cave Painting Display** – HTML page with flickering campfire
